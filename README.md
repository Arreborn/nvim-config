# Whacky Neovim config

This repo is my own personal Neovim config which I obsess over. Use it at your own peril.

I'll try to keep a little changelog here. No promises how up-to-date it is.

## Changelog

- **250227**: Switched a lot of stuff over from Telescope to Snacks picker. Still a few plugins that require Telescope, so it stays for now. But most changes should work just as they used to, just faster and prettier.
